            <h3 id="lightblueHeader">My Modeling Career</h3>

            <p id="lightbluePara">I first started working with my prefered 3D modeling software, Blender, about 3 years ago. When I first opened up blender I was trying to create a 3D model for a video game I was working on, but I had no idea what I was getting into. My first model ever was a simple chair. It was very low quality and looked terrible, but I remember it taking me hours. I must have enjoyed myself because since then I havent stopped modeling and using Blender. My most recent models are far better than my early work. I hope to keep improving my skills and someday be able to make a living off of making 3D models. Before that though, I still have a lot to learn.</p>

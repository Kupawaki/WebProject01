            <p id="lightbluePara">A 3D model is just what you might have guessed from the name. It is a three dimensional representation of an object. Just like any real-life object, 3D models are made up of points (called verticies), edges, and faces. 3D models can be anything as simple as a cube, to something as extravagent as an entire city. The art of 3D modeling refers to when an artist manipulates verticies, edges, and faces to form something they wish to create. Remeber pottery class, when you would mold the clay to create shapes? The idea is almost exactly the same, just instead of physical interraction, 3D modelers use special computer software.</p>
            
            
            <h3 id="darkblueHeader">What are 3D models used for?</h3>
            
            <p id="darkbluePara">The uses for 3D models are already great in number and will likley only continue to expand. With training, nearly any object can be recreated as a 3D model, no matter how big or how complex it may be. In fact, models are begining to be used in the medical field to create 3D printed organs. Other uses include: </p>

            <h3 id="lightblueHeader">Creating a 3D model</h3>
            
            <p id="lightbluePara">To create a 3D model you will first need special software. Some popular one's are Blender, 3DMaxStudio, and Maya. The process of actually creating a model is long and complicated and can be done in many different ways. Personally, I like to get an idea or a reference image, along with a theme and go from there. Typically I start with a primitive shape, such as a cube and begin molding it to fit the shape of my vision. Once the model's shape looks how you like it you can move on to texturing and shading. Before, you were just working with shapes and lots of numbers, but if you stop there the model would look gray and boring. The process of texturing and shading is taking a bland colored model and turning it into something truley spectacular.</p>
